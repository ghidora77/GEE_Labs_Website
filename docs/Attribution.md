The foundation of these lab exercises was generously shared with us by Nicholas Clinton (Google) and Dr. David Saah (University of San Francisco, Geospatial Analysis Lab). We extend our gratitude to them for contributing to the public good and assume responsibility for any errors that may have arisen from our adaptation.

Elinor Ben-Ami and Ozzy Campos have further developed and customized these labs and exercises, integrating them into the course taught at Virginia Tech titled 'Remote Sensing for Social Science'.

We also wish to acknowledge the extensive use of the `geemap` package, developed by Qiusheng Wu. This tool has significantly enriched the content and capabilities of our course materials:
